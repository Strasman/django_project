# django_project
I created a blog website using Python and Django, and I'm happy to say that it's up and running!
You can check it out at http://strasman.pythonanywhere.com/. 

The goal of this project was to learn Django and improve my programming skills, and I had a lot of fun doing it.
I hope you'll like the blog too! 

So far, I've been able to implement all of the key features that I had planned for the site.
Users can create accounts, log in, and publish blog posts.
They can also search for specific topics. 
I've also made sure to follow best practices for website security, so users can feel safe and secure while using the blog. 

Moving forward, I plan to continue improving the site and adding new features.
I'm also open to any feedback or suggestions that you may have. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this progress report.
I'm excited to see where this project takes me!
